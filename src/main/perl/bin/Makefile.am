#
# A NOTE ABOUT `PERLINCLUDE'
# --------------------------
#
# In most cases you'll want to use a -I "somepath" when compiling the
# perl script (perl -wc $@) to make sure the perl scripts or modules
# you are building can find the necessary modules you are using in the
# script. You'll note below that this template includes 3 default
# include paths.
# 
# YMMV, depending upon your build tree and other factors, however you
# should not be tricked into assuming your build is working when you
# are in fact using include paths OUTSIDE your build tree and you have
# previously installed the package you are building!
#
# Additionally, you should be aware of the difference between
# $(srcdir) and $(builddir) as they relate to VPATH builds when doing
# `make distcheck'
#
# You will also note that $(perl5libdir) is LAST in this order to
# further insulate you from being duped into thinking that you are
# using the newly built perl modules when in fact you might be
# using those already installed.
# 
# Note further that $(builddir)../lib is included as a perl include path on the
# assumption that your project most likely (but not always) builds
# perl modules as well.
#
# Lastly, the order of the build is therefore important.  You'll want
# to build the src/main/perl/lib first, so these perl modules are
# available to you as you build your perl scripts.  Accordingly,
# src/main/perl/Makefile.am is told to recurse the directories as
# follows:
#
# SUBDIRS = . lib bin
# 
# Laying out your build tree is not a mindless task and you should
# consider the intradependencies of the components within the project
# when making those decisions.   Of course, it's not rocket science
# either. ;-)
